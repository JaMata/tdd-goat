Hey people,

This is my go at Test-Driven Development with Python [2nd Edition].
Really trying to learn Django at the moment.  Will probably add onto
the tutorial site with data heavy technologies (Hadoop tools, NoSQL, D3.js, sweet Python scripts, etc.).
I've got 15 O'Reilly books that I need to read and implement so this will be
an on-going and active repo!

Best,
