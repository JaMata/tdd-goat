Hey people,

This is my go at Test-Driven Development with Python [2nd Edition].
Really trying to learn Django at the moment.  Will probably add on to
the tutorial site with data heavy technologies (Hadoop, NoSQL, D3.js).
I've got 15 O'Reilly books that I need to read and implement so this will be
an on-going and active repo!

Best,
